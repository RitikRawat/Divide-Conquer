DIVIDE AND CONQUER

Divide and conquer algoriths work by recursively dividing a given problem into smaller, similar sub-problems.
The main parts of a divide and conquer algorithm are -
1)  Divide - Divide the giver problem into smaller sub-problems.
2) Conquer - Solving the smaller sub-problems.
3) Combine - Combining the results.


In this repo, I will be adding D&C algorithms I am studying as part of my Algorithms course at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara.
